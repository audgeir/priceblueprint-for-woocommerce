# PriceBlueprint — Configurable Product Pricing for WooCommerce

Reusable pricing blueprints for WooCommerce. Assign one blueprint to multiple products — define attribute-based pricing rules once, update everywhere instantly.

## How It Works

WooCommerce variations grow exponentially: 4 sizes × 3 materials × 3 colors = 36 variations to create and maintain. PriceBlueprint replaces that with rules.

1. **Create a Blueprint** — add attributes and set a price modifier per value (Size XL → +$10, Material Leather → +$25)
2. **Assign to products** — one blueprint works on any number of products
3. **Update once** — change a rule and every linked product reflects the new price immediately

No variations are created or stored. Rules grow linearly, not exponentially.
